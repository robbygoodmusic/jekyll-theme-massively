<span class="teaser">Payton is a young Black man with a chance to marry into the upper echelons of Black society. But first he must abandon a secret, an unborn child with an ex-girlfriend. He is in desperate need of money and time away from his fianc√©, who knows nothing about the baby. He finds a solution in wealthy and stubborn Gregory Devereaux (Keith David), an elderly regular from his favorite late-night diner. Hired by Devereaux's estranged daughter as his caretaker, Payton quickly becomes Gregory's confidant, and Payton's problems seem to disappear. But as Devereaux nears death - with the wedding and the baby's birth fast approaching - Gregory's past sins force Payton to reckon with his own decisions as a man. He must finally choose: marry rich, or do what's right.</span>
