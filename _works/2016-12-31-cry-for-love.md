Cry For Love is a piece written to reach people in a purely emotional sense. When dealing with the hardships of life, it can be difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and yet so easy to give up and think of past mistakes, to have to weave through a constant barrage of hardship and difficulty. In the end, it may eventually even feel as though struggle and gradual suffering is the norm, but there is always a time of passing, and to embrace that moment where we can move on and see the happiness and beauty again, we must have that will to change. By finding forms of emotional expression, for any and every individual person in the world, we can let those feelings of chaos and distraught fade away, and replace them with our own inner happiness and warmth and, most of all, love. There is no sense in looking into the past for answers, when the present is here and now, and within the present, we can find the change in ourselves needed to make a better future, because love is, and has always been, the answer.
