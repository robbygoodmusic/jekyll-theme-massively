This is one of those slow and meditative pieces of music which seems to unfold at a snail's pace. But it is blisteringly fast in comparison to the duration of a complete lunar cycle.

<p class="teaser">It is a ten-minute microcosm of the monthly waxing and waning to which we are all witness.</p>

Its title comes from a tiny Carl Sandburg poem called "Light and Moonbells". I have no idea what moonbells are, but I have a feeling that moonbells are ultimately what this piece aims to depict.
