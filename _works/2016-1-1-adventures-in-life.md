This piece was written in dedication to Mr. O, my physical education teacher in eighth grade and one of the most influential and inspirational figures I have ever been lucky enough to have met. The text was written around the stories he would tell us of his own life, and the phrase “Be Extraordinary,” a phrase that he would always tell us and one that I carry with me each and every day.
