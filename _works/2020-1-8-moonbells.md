<p class="teaser">This is one of those slow and meditative pieces of music which seems to unfold at a snail's pace.</p> 

But its pace is blistering in comparison to the duration of a complete lunar cycle. _Moonbells_ is a ten-minute microcosm of the monthly waxing and waning to which we are all witness.

Its title comes from a tiny Carl Sandburg poem called "Light and Moonbells". I do not know what moonbells are, but I have a feeling that they are ultimately what this piece aims to depict.
