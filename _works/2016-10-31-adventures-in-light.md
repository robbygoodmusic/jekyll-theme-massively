Adventures in Light is a piece meant to be seen as a cycle, much as light and darkness themselves are an endless cycle, beginning with light, followed by the envelopment of a slowly encroaching darkness, and beginning once more after the slow rise of light once more. The piece is meant to be free, felt, and flexible, so, as notated throughout the piece, many of the effects act as “rise and fall” elements. Light is represented by the note A, particularly the A above middle C. Throughout the entirety of the first and second movements, the pitch of A is always present, but throughout the third and fourth movements, A is never seen until the end, meant to represent the beginning of the piece once again and the return of the light. The idea of darkness is represented by the opposite spectrum: lower marimba sounds and uncertain, harsh drumming rhythms. Darkness also contains a recurring note in that of Eb, the farthest note from A. In summary, the idea of the piece is to create contrast between that of the light and dark worlds.
