The inspiration for this piece came to me on a late night bus ride on the freeway. I was looking out the window and there was no light whatsoever, just this deep, black void staring back at me. There was no way for me to tell where I was, what may be happening beyond the glass - it felt to me as though this bus had escaped any semblance of reality and that we could just ride forever and never reach any sort of concrete destination. _DESTINATION: null_ was written as a means to encompass that feeling, with the first movement acting as a sort of never-ending anticlimax, reaching out with the semblance of understanding what may be happening and then slowly retracting that notion. The second movement is when that feeling begins to seep into the psyche, creating a sort of fight-or-flight reaction and the need to escape, or to find some sense of progression, until abruptly an end is reached.
