<p class="teaser">Every morning, I wake up my creative mind by writing a short four-part chorale.</p>

Later in the day, I sight-read one of Bachâ€™s 371 chorale harmonizations at the piano. These three chorales, written for Alvin Wang at the Curtis Institute of Music Young Artist Summer Program, began as sketches in my morning chorale notebook, and are an outgrowth of my daily chorale-writing and -playing routine.
