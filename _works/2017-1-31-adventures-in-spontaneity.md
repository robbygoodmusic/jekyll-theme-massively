Adventures in Spontaneity follows a small collection of motifs through a variety of different sound worlds and styles, ranging from dramatic to humorous to intimate to outright uncontrollable. The "spontaneity" in the title comes from the constantly jumping from one texture to another, with very little transition or expectation in between. The piece is energetic, explosive, enthusiastic, an exciting romp from one end to the other.
