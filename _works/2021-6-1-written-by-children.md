I asked three very young composers, Madisen (Age 6), Aubreigh (Age 8), and Lucy (Age 8) to each compose a short melody. Then I expanded upon their imaginative melodies to create a longer piece. The result of this collaboration is _Written by Children_, composed by the four of us for my friend Rachel Boehl.
