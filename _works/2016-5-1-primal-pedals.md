This piece was written as a sort of exploration into more experimental techniques in a soloistic environment. Throughout the composition process, I was in close contact with the eventual performer, Alice Teyssier, who showed me the breadth of possibilities I could explore with the flute family of instruments, out of which we eventually settled upon the bass flute, as it had the most pronounced expression of non-traditional sound. Within our composer-performer sessions, Alice eventually brought up the idea of using a loop pedal, and with that, _Primal Pedals_ was born.
