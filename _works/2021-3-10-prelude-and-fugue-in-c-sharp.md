_Prelude and Fugue in C-Sharp_ was written for Stefano Greco, a renowned Bach scholar and interpreter of Bachâ€™s keyboard music. Bach started his Well-Tempered Clavier with the key of C, so I thought I would begin with C-sharp, close to Bach but different. The funereal prelude flirts with the key of C-sharp, while the life-affirming fugue proclaims C-sharp with childlike enthusiasm.
