Living in Los Angeles-based area inevitably brings with it a life with almost unending hustle and bustle, so much to the point where one might up and forget what it feels like to breathe a little deeper than usual. One night, during the winter break from my university studies, I was struggling to compose anything due to experiencing intense burnout at the time, so I took a walk outside and spent the entire time staring up at the full moon. While focusing on the moon, I heard this sort of longing melodic call echo through my head, and upon returning home, I layered that call onto a constant unsteady drone, creating what is one of my most meditative and intimate pieces to date.
