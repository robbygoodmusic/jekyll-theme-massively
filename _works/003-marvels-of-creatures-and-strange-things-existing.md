<p class="teaser">Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century book <i>Marvels of Creatures and Strange Things Existing</i> was the catalogue to end all catalogues.</p>

It contains descriptions of every living thing in existenceâ€”that includes not only plants and animals, but monsters and demons and gods. You will find next to a drawing of a common trout a detailed depiction of a sailor-consuming sea serpent.

My eponymous work is a set of six character pieces for piano, each inspired by a creature from this strange and marvelous book.
