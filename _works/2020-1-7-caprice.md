<p class="teaser">The word <i>caprice</i> (or the Italian <i>capriccioso</i>) has meant many things to many composers throughout history. (You might say that weâ€™re capricious about caprices.)</p>

Some assert, through their music, that a caprice must be humorous, light-hearted; others say it must be whimsical and improvisatory, or dazzlingly virtuosic. 

In this brief duet I offer my personal definition of a caprice.
