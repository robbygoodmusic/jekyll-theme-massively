<i>"The Combine is a piece inspired by Ken Kesey’s realistic fiction novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Within the story, “the Combine” is used as a sort of overarching allegory for the real world, as seen from the perspective of the mentally disturbed main character. Within the piece, each instrument, aside from the piano, fills a sort of role as a loose representation of the characters within the story. The piano, in turn, serves as a sort of tone setter throughout the piece, staying more towards the back of the ensemble. The piece essentially highlights the power struggle between the flute, the instrument attempting to force the ensemble into a strict monotonous groove, and the cello, which attempts to disrupt the strict motion of the piece and turn it on its head metrically, tonally, and colorfully. The Combine is meant to serve less as a direct retelling of Ken Kesey’s story, but more of a quick symbolic reimagining."</i>

## Adventures in Light

For percussion quartet, c. 5'30" - 2016

<iframe width="49%" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/797883481&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=false"></iframe>

<i>“Adventures in Light is a piece meant to be seen as a cycle, much as light and darkness themselves are an endless cycle, beginning with light, followed by the envelopment of a slowly encroaching darkness, and beginning once more after the slow rise of light once more. The piece is meant to be free, felt, and flexible, so, as notated throughout the piece, many of the effects act as “rise and fall” elements. Light is represented by the note A, particularly the A above middle C. Throughout the entirety of the first and second movements, the pitch of A is always present, but throughout the third and fourth movements, A is never seen until the end, meant to represent the beginning of the piece once again and the return of the light. The idea of darkness is represented by the opposite spectrum: lower marimba sounds and uncertain, harsh drumming rhythms. Darkness also contains a recurring note in that of Eb, the farthest note from A. In summary, the idea of the piece is to create contrast between that of the light and dark worlds."</i>
