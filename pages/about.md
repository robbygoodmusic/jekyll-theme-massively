                <p>Born (1999) and raised in Los Angeles, <b>Kian Ravaei</b> has written for a variety of ensembles ranging from chamber to choral to orchestral. Much of his work stems from a love and respect for the music of his Iranian ancestors. His liminal identity as an Iranian-American is reflected in his music, which employs materials from and embodies the spirit of both cultures.</p>
                <p>His recent work aims to shed light upon political events past and present, addressing topics such as national identity, migration, and commercialism. He is currently earning his B.A. in Music Composition at UCLA, where he studies with Kay Rhie and David Lefkowitz.</p>
